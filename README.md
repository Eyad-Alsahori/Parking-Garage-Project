# Parking-Garage-Project
This Parking Garage program plays a role in managing cars that arrive and depart, it keeps track of the number of moves each car takes as well as other information such as available parking spots and garage capacity. These vehicles can be assigned to different parking spaces depending on the situation, providing optimal vehicle flow as well as minimizing car moves, resulting in an effective method to manage parking spaces.
